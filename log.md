### **Day 1:** *12 Jul 2017*
Today **I did**:  Worked on my main portfolio remake a bit.  
**I learned:**  I did this over the previous couple of days and didn't really do much work on it for this day.  It was really busy and didn't have as much time as I thought...so I counted the previous days of working on the portfolio before I started the challenge.

### **Day 2:** *13 Jul 2017*
Today **I did**:  Invitation Page  
**I learned:**  Getting formatting exactly the way you want it with flexbox is both easy and hard at the same time.  It'll do exactly what you want it to, but sometimes you gotta play with it a lot first. (that's what she said...)

### **Day 3:** *14 Jul 2017*
Today **I did**:  Tourist Attraction Page  
**I learned:**  I didn't know what to do for this prompt, so I figured I'd just pick my wifes favorite place.  I used most of the same techniques as I did yesterday so didn't really learn anything new except that if I want to get 1 site finished per day, I'm going to need to plan sites that are a little simpler.  I keep running out of time in the day

### **Day 4:** *15 Jul 2017*
Today **I did**:  Product Page  
**I learned:**  Simple is good, but even simple can take a while to design when you are still learning.  I played with height and width settings in flexbox css as well as working on learning on what the best method will be for creating a sticky navigation.  display: sticky works excellently, but is very poorly supported in most browsers so it's a no-go.

### **Day 5:** *16 Jul 2017*
Today **I did**:  Restaurant Menu Page  
**I learned:**  Keep it simple and I can get a site completed!  I still have to do the mobile friendly aspect of things, but I wasn't really including that in the finished product requirement so I still consider it done.  I need to work on playing with image layouts.  Learned a lot about controlling width of horizontal columns and containers within them.  Using image width to control size/columns of images with wrapping in flexbox.

### **Day 5.5:** *17 Jul 2017*
Today **I did**:  Build a repo for #30Days30Sites  
**I learned:**  A little about markup.  Today was a rest day, no prompt in the email so I figured I'd take a little time to work on this repo I've wanted to do.

### **Day 6:** *18 Jul 2017*
Today **I did**:  Worked on a friends site, HCTownes.com, because it fit the prompt of book/author.  
**I learned:**  Not sure I actually learned anything new today.  I just played around with layout for about an hour trying to get something to look good and never did end up liking it.  Waiting to get a photo to use in that area and I think it will pick it up a lot.

### **Day 7:** *19 Jul 2017*
Today **I did**:  Started a website for a fake movie  
**I learned:**  Can truthfully say I didn't learn anything today other than it's not fun to code after a super long and stressful day, and turns out to be really unproductive when you aren't in the mood to do it.

### **Day 8:** *20 Jul 2017*
Today **I did**:  Added content to movie website  
**I learned:**  Didn't learn anything specific, just normal html and css workings

### **Day 9:** *21 Jul 2017*
Today **I did**:  Researched methods of hiding/showing text with a clickable link, incorporated this into the fake movie site.  
**I learned:**  How to make a simple javascript function and assign it to a link within the html.  Turned out to be a lot simpler than I thought

### **Day 10:** *22 Jul 2017*
Today **I did**:  I spent most of the day chatting with Chingu members as this was the start of the build to learn projects.  I did not work on any websites but I did make a lot of new connections and planned a few things for the future.  

### **Day 11:** *23 Jul 2017*
